### Instructions for deploying this project on WAMP

## Installation

- install WAMP from `http://www.wampserver.com/en/`

- install Composer from `https://getcomposer.org/`

- Type `composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"` in command line interface to install Laravel framework.

- Add `~/.composer/vendor/bin` to your PATH environment variable to let you use laravel from the command line.

  In Windows 8 this directory should be something like
  `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
  (replace "YOUR_USER_NAME" with your actual user name)

  If you cannot find it, search for the `Composer` directory in your system drive.

## Configuration

- Edit `PATH\TO\WAMP\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\conf\httpd.conf`, search for `<Directory />`, change `"Require all denied"` to `"Require all granted"` (without the quotes)

  Note. `"PATH\TO\WAMP"` should be replaced with your WAMP installation path.

- After you start WAMP server, click the status icon of it, choose `Apache` -> `Apache Modules` -> Check `rewrite_module`

## Test installation

- Type `laravel new APP_NAME` in command line to make a new laravel app called APP_NAME (replace APP_NAME with a name for your app).

  It will be added to your current working directory.

- To add an WAMP alias to the public folder, click your WAMP status icon and choose `Apache` -> `Alias Directories` -> `Add an alias`, then follow the instructions to add your `/PATH/TO/APP_NAME/public/` directory as an alias with name `ALIAS_NAME` (replace "ALIAS_NAME" with a actual name to suit your need)

- Edit `PATH\TO\APP_NAME\public\.htaccess`, add a line with `RewriteBase /ALIAS_NAME` (replace "ALIAS_NAME" with what you used)

- Now you should be able to access `http://localhost/ALIAS_NAME/` and `http://localhost/ALIAS/home`

  Note the last "/" of the first address should not be omitted.

- To access the page with `http://localhost/ALIAS_NAME`, edit `PATH\TO\WAMP\alias\ALIAS_NAME.conf`
  Change the first line from something like:
  ```
  Alias /ALIAS_NAME/ "PATH/TO/BLOG/"
  ```
  to
  ```
  Alias /ALIAS_NAME "PATH/TO/BLOG/"
  ```
  Now, accessing from `http://localhost/ALIAS_NAME` should be okay.


- Laravel uses a `.env` file at `PATH\TO\APP_NAME\` to store some environment related configuration, copy from `.env.example` (if `.env` doesn't already exist) and modify it.
